# Algorithms-Compilation


Python and Matlab is like scratchwork at this point since I know I can do it. 


#This is more or less a repository of me learning and my past public work. 
I need a list of the new programming languages that would be useful to learn. 


Then the ones that I've poked around in and need a better more substatntial algorithm for... 
Perl...Selenium...Julia.
